Getting Started

Started with the wireframes in Adobe XD. Then I filled up the HTML file with the information I thought was going to be need.
From there, I followed the wireframes as close as possible to create the styling of the website in a CSS file which was linked to the HTML file.

Prerequisites

As I could not find a suitable API, I created a JSON data to get the required data for my website.

I first created a .json file and then from there I searched for restaurants on the internet, and got their addresses from Google Maps.
Then I got the restaurant websites, which the user can go to for more info about the restaurant.
With all this information, I made a list in the.json file which contained the different cuisines.
Under the cuisines, I added in the respective restaurants' data.

Improvements(Add on ideas)

Implement a program to help the user navigate to the restaurant. 
Display the reviews of the restaurant and also allow the user to add their own ratings or reviews. 
However, I did not add it in as i was incapable of doing so.
