Design Process

Started with the wireframes in Adobe XD. Then I filled up the HTML file with the information I thought was going to be need.
From there, i created a sticky nav bar with CSS with references from online platforms like W3schools. I also refered to some of the CAs
to create some features on the website. One of which is the Random User CA, which refered to and modified it to my own needs.
I then added some styling like the background image and colors to the web page.
From there, I made a JSON data of the restaurants I wanted to display. 

Improvements(Add on ideas)

Some ideas I wanted to implement was to navigate the user to the restaurant. 
Another idea was to display the reviews of the restaurant and also allow the user to add their own ratings or reviews. 
However, I did not add it in as i was incapable of doing so.
In the end the program did not work as I wanted it to, as I wasn't able to get the search value to match the cuisine in JSON data.
However, I was still able to pull out the data and display it on the box(when I did not add the code to match the cuisine the user's input).
